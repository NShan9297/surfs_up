# surfs_up: Shop Investors Analysis # 

# ** Overview ** #

The purpose of this project was to use SQLite, Pandas, ad SQLAlchemy to assess the temperatures for the Months of June and December on the island of Oahu. This is provide investors with the opportunity to assess the sustainability of a combo ice cream/surf shop, and if investing in this venture would be profitable. Temperatures from June and December were pulled from the data and the statistics for each data set was calculated. 


# ** Results ** #
-the maximum temperatures for June and December are similar, at 85 and 83 degrees respectively 
-the minumum temperature for June and December are 64 and 56 degress, respectively. This is an 8 degrees difference
-the data taken from June was 1700 figures and the data from December was 1517
-the standard deviation of the data sets is also similar for June and December at 3.26 and 3.75 respectively


# ** Summary ** #
In conclusioln, we see there is a discrepancy in the values collected as there are 183 more collected for June than December. This could potentially skew the data to bring the numbers a bit lower or higher based on the sample size as that is roughly an 8th of the data set. If all of these numbers looked more like the numbers in June, this may have brought the data up to look more like June. The descriptive statistics also suggest this as the there is only a 3 degree difference at the 75th percentile. I believe that if the data that appears to be missing was added to the data set, the figures would look more like June's. 

With interest in the investors safety, the precipitation for June and December should both have been included in the queries. As surfing and getting ice cream are frquently good weather activities, if it rains a lot in December, you won't see as much revenue as in June, assuming June is not a rainy month. Also, depending on the location of the shop, it may see more rain than other areas of the island. As location is important, I would have done another query at the station closest to the prospective location of the shop and compared it to others.

Ultimately, as an investor I would be somewhat hesitant, but iterpolating from the real world, Hawaii is a destination location and if Oahu was well-visited island-this would be a great venture.
